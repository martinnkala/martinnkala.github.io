            <h2>Welcome to Temple Inn & Suites</h2>
            <p>
              "Prepare now for the temple, the mountain of the Lord. 
              Never allow the goal of the temple to be out of your sight.
               Walk into His presence in purity and virtue,
               and receive His blessings—even 'all that he hath.'"

            <p>
              Our vision at Temple Inn and Suites is to make your stay as
              comfortable and stress free as possible--whether you come for a
              few days to participate in a family members' wedding, or many
              months and even years as you serve as a Temple Worker. We are
              conveniently located just outside Temple grounds in select
              locations to make your commute as short as possible. Please visit
              our guest portal to learn more about accomodations and services at
              a Temple Inn near you.

            &ldquo;Building and maintaining temples may not change your life,
             but spending your time in the temple surely will. 
             To those who have long been absent from the temple, 
             I encourage you to prepare and return as soon as possible. 
             Then I invite you to worship in the temple and pray to feel
              deeply the Savior’s infinite love for you, that each of you may 
              gain your own testimony that He directs this sacred
               and ageless work.&ldquo; - Russell M. Nelson
